# Multi-Agent QA System

Welcome! This project is a comprehensive, LLM-powered multi-agent QA system that acts like a full-stack mobile QA team, built on top of Agent-S and Android World.

## 🚀 What is This?

Think of it as a team of smart, specialized bots (agents) that work together to test mobile apps—just like a real QA team, but faster and tireless! Each agent has a unique job:

1. **Planner Agent**: Breaks down big testing goals into actionable steps.
2. **Executor Agent**: Actually performs those steps in the Android UI, like a robot finger.
3. **Verifier Agent**: Checks if the app did what it was supposed to after each step.
4. **Supervisor Agent**: Looks at the whole test, gives feedback, and suggests improvements.

## 🏗️ How Does It Work?

# (You can use your own repo URLs)
git clone <agent-s-repo>
git clone <android-world-repo>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Multi-Agent QA System

A comprehensive multi-agent LLM-powered system that functions as a full-stack mobile QA team on top of Agent-S and Android World.

## Overview

This system extends the modular architecture of Agent-S, where agents use LLMs + learned policies to collaboratively complete tasks in a mobile UI environment. The system consists of four specialized agents:

1. **Planner Agent** - Parses high-level QA goals and decomposes them into subgoals
2. **Executor Agent** - Executes subgoals in the Android UI environment with grounded mobile gestures
3. **Verifier Agent** - Determines whether the app behaves as expected after each step
4. **Supervisor Agent** - Reviews entire test episodes and proposes improvements

```

2. **Open your browser** and go to: `http://localhost:5000`

3. **Configure API keys** at: `http://localhost:5000/setup`
   - Choose which LLM providers you have API keys for
   - Test your API keys to ensure they work
   - Or use mock mode for development without real API keys

4. **Execute tests** at: `http://localhost:5000/execute`
   - Configure your test parameters
   - Monitor agent status in real-time
   - View execution logs as they happen
   - See results and download reports

5. **View history** at: `http://localhost:5000/history`
   - Browse all past executions
   - View detailed reports with screenshots
   - Export execution data
   - Analyze trends and performance

### Command Line Interface

### Command Line Interface

For advanced users or automation, you can also use the command line interface:

3. **Set up environment variables** (if not using web interface):
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-api-key"  # Optional
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-google-api-key"        # Optional
```

4. **Create configuration files**:
```bash
cd multi_agent_qa
python -c "from utils.config_utils import create_sample_config_files; create_sample_config_files()"
```

### Single Test Execution

Run a single QA test with the default WiFi settings task:

```bash
python main.py --mode single --task "Test turning WiFi on and off"
```
