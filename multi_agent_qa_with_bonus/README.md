# Multi-Agent QA System with Android in the Wild Bonus 🤖📱

Welcome! This project is a comprehensive, LLM-powered multi-agent QA system that acts like a full-stack mobile QA team, built on top of Agent-S and Android World. **Now featuring complete Android in the Wild dataset integration for enhanced training and video reproduction!**

## 🚀 What is This?

Think of it as a team of smart, specialized bots (agents) that work together to test mobile apps—just like a real QA team, but faster and tireless! Each agent has a unique job:

1. **Planner Agent**: Breaks down big testing goals into actionable steps.
2. **Executor Agent**: Actually performs those steps in the Android UI, like a robot finger.
3. **Verifier Agent**: Checks if the app did what it was supposed to after each step.
4. **Supervisor Agent**: Looks at the whole test, gives feedback, and suggests improvements.

## 🎯 **NEW: Bonus Features - Android in the Wild Integration**

🔥 **This system now includes complete Android in the Wild dataset integration with:**
- **Video Processing**: Automatically process real user interaction videos
- **Enhanced Training**: Generate 15+ training points per agent from real user data
- **Video Reproduction**: Reproduce user video sequences with multi-agent coordination
- **Real-world Learning**: Train agents on actual Android user behavior patterns
- **Performance Metrics**: Compare agent performance against ground truth user actions

# Multi-Agent QA System with Android in the Wild Integration

A comprehensive multi-agent LLM-powered system that functions as a full-stack mobile QA team on top of Agent-S and Android World. **Now featuring complete Android in the Wild dataset integration for enhanced training and video reproduction.**

## Overview

This system extends the modular architecture of Agent-S, where agents use LLMs + learned policies to collaboratively complete tasks in a mobile UI environment. The system consists of four specialized agents working together, enhanced with real-world training data from the Android in the Wild dataset:

1. **Planner Agent** - Parses high-level QA goals and decomposes them into subgoals
2. **Executor Agent** - Executes subgoals in the Android UI environment with grounded mobile gestures
3. **Verifier Agent** - Determines whether the app behaves as expected after each step
4. **Supervisor Agent** - Reviews entire test episodes and proposes improvements

**🔥 Bonus Enhancement**: All agents are enhanced with training data generated from real user interaction videos, providing more realistic and robust testing capabilities.
